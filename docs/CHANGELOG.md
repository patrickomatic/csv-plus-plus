## v0.2.0

### **Breaking Changes**

- Removal of the $$ operator - to dereference variables you can just reference them by name and they will be resolved if they are defined.  Otherwise they will be left alone in the output

### Non-breaking Changes

- Excel: fix the merging of existing values 
- CSV: fix the merging of existing values 
- Support merging in values from CSV (previously it would ignore/overwrite them)
- Allow for more generous spacing in the csv section (and reflect this in the examples)
- More type coverage

## v0.1.3

- Proper scoping of variables defined within an expand modifier
- Types via Sorbet
- Fix formula insertion on Excel

## v0.1.2

- var=... modifier which allows binding a variable to a cell

## v0.1.1

- Better support for the various infix operators (+,-,/,*,^,%,=,<,etc)
  * Previously we were converting them to their prefix equivalent (multiply, minus, concat, etc) but excel doesn't support most of those.  So we keep them infix
  * Didn't support some infix operators (^, %, </>/<=/>=/<>)
  * Proper support for operator precedence
- When in verbose mode, print a summary of compiled functions and variables
- docs & tests
