# Language Reference

While csv++ is a superset of CSV, it adds several features that we'll explore.

* Re-usable functions and variables
* A module-loading import system
* The ability to specify cell-level options (text formatting, alignment, etc)
* A `fill` feature that is akin to dragging the bottom-right of a cell in a spreadsheet.
